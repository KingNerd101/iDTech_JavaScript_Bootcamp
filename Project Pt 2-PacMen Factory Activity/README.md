# Project Pt 2 - PacMen Factory Activity
# For this assignment I
#   Firstly set the newimg varible styles to the correct posistion, left being x, and top being y.
#   Secondly, I simply appended the child, the newimg varible, to the main game varible.

#   Finally, I simply checked the each item's posistion is above or below the bounds of the window, and both reversing its velocity varible, and re setting its posistion to the correct place.




 newimg.style.left = position.x;
  newimg.style.top = position.y;
  

  // TODO add new Child image to game
  game.appendChild(newimg);
