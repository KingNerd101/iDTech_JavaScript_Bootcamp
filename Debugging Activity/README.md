# Debugging Activity

# For the first example I 
#   Set the x value to 5 instead of 0, because it supposed to go down, not up.
#   And I flipped the inequalty sign on line 34 so for the same rason as before.

# For the second example I
#   Made the varible created in the for loop a let instead a const, because if it is a const, it cannot ever change, and for each loops need to change the varible.
#   I also simply called the checkPoint2 because it was never called.

# For the third example I
#   I called, simply called the checkPoint3 because it was never called.
#   I also added the needed function parameters on line 28

# For the fourth example I:
#   I simply set the password string right off the bat, because it was not being declared, so it didn't work in the code's eyes.
