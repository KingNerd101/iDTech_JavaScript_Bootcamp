# Unit Testing Activity
# For this assignment, I made a bunch of different if statemnets each basically asking a question
#   is it capitalized?
#   is it an array?
#   does it exist?
# And after returns the value that it thinks that it should, so if it is capitalized, than it should capitalize the, "HI!".
# It could return something similar to:
# HELLO [name]!
# hello [name].
# hello [name1] and [name2]!
# HELLO [name1] AND [name2]!
